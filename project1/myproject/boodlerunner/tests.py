from django.test import TestCase

# Create your tests here.
#Initial Test Plan:
#We plan implementing three modes of testing. 
############################################
#First, is the single component test. This test will consist of breaking our application into each of its individual components in order to examine singular efficiency. 
#This test allows our group to troubleshoot our application more effectively, thus allowing our group to single out each part that has problems instead of a holistic approach.
############################################
#Second, our group plans on gathering a group of three individual volunteers to engage in usability testing. 
#This will consist of the volunteer being instructed to navigate to our website and attempt to use the features. 
#Our goal is to observe and take note of what the initial intended purpose of our website is and 
#further gather information on how easy it is for users to achieve their goal through using our application. This will allow our group to make necessary design 
#changing and observe possible additions in a non-biased atmosphere.
############################################
#Third, our group will implement a python scripting automated testing feature that will populate our database with 
#test information that we will then check for correctness of the database.
#This will be done using true-false, it will return a list that contains feature names and status.
